# Matrix_calculator

## Describtion
For the sake of transferring theoretical knowledge into its practical form, This small project was built. After studying Linear Algebra,
I realized how can some exercises be an extremely tedious and time-consuming process.
I needed something to validate my solutions. That is where this project comes in handy.
Finally, this project has the ability to perform 9 different operations. 

## Usage
When the program starts the user will be prompted with a collection of actions. The user will choose one of them using the command line.

The options are

Add matrices:

When chosen, the user will be asked to input two matrices.The program will check if it's possible to perform it depending on Linear Algebra rules.
if possible, the program will do it.

Multiply matrix by a constant:

The user will input a matrix and a constant. Simply, each element will get multiplied by the constnat.
